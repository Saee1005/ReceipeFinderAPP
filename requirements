Functional Requirements
1. Core Features
Recipe Search:

Allow users to search for recipes using keywords.
Display search results with a list of recipes, including a thumbnail image, recipe name, and basic details.
Recipe Details:

Show detailed information about a selected recipe, including:
Ingredients
Cooking steps
Nutritional information
Provide options to view external links to full recipes (if applicable).
Save Favorites:

Enable users to save recipes for offline access.
Provide a "Favorites" section where saved recipes are listed.
2. Navigation
Complex Navigation:

Stack Navigator: For navigating between screens like search results and recipe details.
Tab Navigator: For main sections like:
Home/Search
Categories
Favorites
Drawer Navigator: For accessing additional sections like:
User Profile
Settings
Help/Support
Responsive UI/UX:

Ensure a smooth and intuitive user experience.
Adapt layouts for different screen sizes and orientations.
3. API Integration
Use a public recipe API (e.g., Spoonacular or Edamam) for fetching recipes.
Handle various scenarios for API requests, such as:
Successful data fetching
No results found
Failed requests (e.g., due to no internet connection)
API rate limits or timeouts
4. Offline Mode
Local Storage:

Use AsyncStorage or SQLite to store user favorites locally.
Ensure recipes in the "Favorites" section are accessible offline.
Data Sync:

Sync offline data with the cloud (optional) when the app regains internet connectivity.
5. Push Notifications
Use Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) or OneSignal to:

Send recipe suggestions or updates on user favorites.
Notify users about new features or app updates.
Ensure notifications are actionable, e.g., clicking on them navigates to the relevant recipe or app section.

Non-Functional Requirements
1. Performance
Optimize the app to load recipes and navigate screens smoothly.
Minimize app size while including all necessary assets.
2. Security
Secure API keys using environment variables or secrets management.
Use HTTPS for API communication.
Handle user data responsibly and comply with data protection standards.
3. Scalability
Design the app architecture to support potential new features like:
Recipe sharing via social media
User authentication (e.g., login/sign-up)
Advanced search filters (e.g., cuisine type, diet restrictions)
4. Cross-Platform Compatibility
Ensure the app functions seamlessly on both iOS and Android.
Test the app on various devices for UI/UX consistency.
Technical Requirements
1. Development Stack
Frontend Framework: React Native
Development Tools:
Expo for rapid development and testing
Firebase/OneSignal for notifications
AsyncStorage/SQLite for offline storage
2. Third-Party Services
Recipe API: Spoonacular or Edamam

3. Testing
Test navigation, API integration, offline functionality, and push notifications.
Use Expo's testing tools or frameworks like Jest for unit testing.
4. Version Control
Use Git for source code management.
Maintain a clear branching strategy (e.g., feature branches, main branch).
